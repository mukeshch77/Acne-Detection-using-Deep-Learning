# Acne Detection using Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This repository implements acne detection using deep learning techniques.  
The goal is to detect acne from images using object detection / segmentation (or classification + localisation) methods so as to automate acne diagnosis or documentation.

The project includes notebooks for model training, evaluation, and inference.  
A pretrained YOLOv8 model (`yolov8n.pt`) is provided for rapid experimentation or deployment.

## Features

- Training using a YOLOv8-based model  
- Datasets configured via YAML specification (`data.yaml`)  
- Support for inference on new images / batches  
- Experiment tracking via notebooks  
- Pretrained model checkpoint included  

---

## Architecture

- **Model:** YOLOv8 (nano version) for object detection of acne lesions  
- **Training Framework:** Ultralytics YOLOv8 (or similar)  
- **Data:** Input images + bounding box annotation for acne lesions  
- **Evaluation metrics:** mAP, precision, recall, etc. (to be detailed)  

---

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- Python 3.7+  
- A GPU if you want reasonable speed for training/inference (optional but recommended)  
- Enough VRAM to load model and images  

### Setup

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mukeshch77/Acne-Detection-using-Deep-Learning.git
cd Acne-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
```

### Install dependencies (example via pip):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: If thereâ€™s no requirements.txt, install core packages manually:
ultralytics, torch, opencv-python, pandas, etc.

### Running Training / Inference

- Training: Use notebook main.ipynb or 100Epoch.ipynb to train the model.

- Data config: Modify data.yaml to point to your training / validation image directories and classes.

- Pretrained model: yolov8n.pt is included; you can load it for inference or fine-tune further.

## Model

- Model architecture: **YOLOv8 nano**  
- Trained on acne detection dataset (images + bounding box annotations)  
- Checkpoint file `yolov8n.pt` provided for usage or further fine-tuning  

---

## Dataset

- The dataset is defined in `data.yaml`, which includes paths to training and validation images, and class labels.  
- If using your own dataset, ensure the directory structure and annotation format is compatible with YOLOv8 (e.g. `.txt` annotation files, or COCO / YOLO formats).
